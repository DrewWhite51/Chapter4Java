// A motel's occupancy rate is calculated as follows:
// Occupancy rate = Number of rooms occupied / Total number of rooms
// Write a program that calculates the occupancy rate for each floor of a motel.
// The program should start by asking for the number of floors in the motel.
// A loop should then iterate once for each floor.
// During each iteration, the loop should ask the user for the number of rooms on the floor and then the number of them that are occupied.
// After all iterations, the program should display the number of rooms the motel has, the number of them that are occupied, and the number that are vacant, and the occupancy rate for the motel.
